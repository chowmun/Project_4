### Project 4

#### Team members: Alfred Tang, Chow Mun Yang, Ferdi Garcia, Jay Lee, Michael Xiao

## Problem Statements

1. How can we correctly predict the presence of WNV-positive mosquitoes?

2. What features are most predictive of WNV-positive mosquito breeding behaviour?

3. What actions can be taken as a long-term solution to the spread of diseases by mosquitoes?

#### Recommendations
1. Maintain healthy levels of natural predators to keep mosquito population at bay
    - Birds, spiders, dragonfly nymphs and diving beetles are natural predators of mosquito larvae, while dragonflies, birds and bats feed on adult mosquitoes.
    - Infected animals cannot transmit to humans unless via a mosquito bite
2. Good mosquito control practices can help reduce mosquito breeding at home
    - Keep your home mosquito free with this detailed [guide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315924484_Best_Practices_for_Integrated_Mosquito_Management_A_Focused_Update)
    - Trap mosquitos that are currently trespassing in your property. Set a [trap](hhttps://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Plastic-Bottle-Mosquito-Trap) 
    - Practice the 3Rs' from the redlineproject [link](http://redlineproject.org/westnilevirus.php)
3. Read up on West Nile Virus and know what preventive measures to take
