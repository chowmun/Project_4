## General Assembly - Data Science Immersive 8
### Project 4 
#### Team members: Alfred Tang, Chow Mun Yang, Ferdi Garcia, Jay Lee, Michael Xiao

## Problem Statement
1. Given historical data, how can we access and locate West-Nile virus positive mosquitoes and significantly mitigate the outspread of its disease?

2. What can environmental trends tell us about mosquito breeding behaviour? 

3. What recommendations can we provide in order to decrease the spread of mosquito-related diseases in the long run?

### Executive Summary

The purpose of this challenge is to determine where and when have the highest west nile activity in our data and which species of mosquitoes are more proned to carry this disease.
